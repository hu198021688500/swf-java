/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of expected behaviour from classes that can map object of a class
 * to and from a subset of the natural numbers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Formally, implementors of this interface are expected to provide an
 * isomorphism from the class they map to a subset of the set of natural
 * numbers. In detail:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The allowed subsets are either
 * <li>Bounded sequences of naturals always starting at 0 and reaching up to
 * <tt>n</tt> &gt; 0. An isomorphism must be provided between this interval and
 * the set of the different values instances of E can take. That means that for
 * objects o1, o2 with corresponding values n1 &lt;= n, n2 &lt;= n, then
 * o1.equals(o2) if and only if n1 == n2, for every n1, n2, o1, o2.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * No instance E can map to a natural greater that <tt>n</tt>, barring a special
 * case described below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For every natural greater than <tt>n</tt>, the implementation is allowed to
 * return a class defined special value, such that for every n1, n2 &gt; n, the
 * corresponding values o1, o2 are such that o1.equals(o2) returns true or o1 ==
 * o2 == null and for every value o3 corresponding to a n3 &lt;= n,
 * o3.equals(o1) returns false. The natural number this special object maps to
 * must always be the same and it is recommended, though not required, to be
 * <tt>n+1</tt>.
 * </p>
 * </li><li>
 * Unbounded sequences, in which case the upper limit is defined as -1. In this
 * case, the mapping is a bijection between the possible values of the class and
 * the set of naturals.</li>
 * <p>
 * Examples are the set of chars mapped by their ordinal and the boolean
 * literals for true = 0, false = 1. Note than for neither of these two the
 * special, above their respective n value, case is provided, although it could
 * be mapped to null.
 * </p>
 * Classes that implement this interface are expected to be implemented as
 * Singleton objects.
